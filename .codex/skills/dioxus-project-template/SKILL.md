# Dioxus Project Template

Use this skill for repository-specific execution context. Follow `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/rules/dioxus-0.7-workflow.md` first for Dioxus 0.7 rules.

## Start Here

1. Confirm the current directory is `D:\Documents\Projects\VC\Rust\dioxus-project-template`.
2. Read `.codex/rules/dioxus-0.7-workflow.md` for Dioxus implementation work.
3. Read the files directly involved in the request before editing.
4. Keep web and desktop support intact unless the request is explicitly platform-specific.
5. Prefer the existing `packages/ui`, `packages/web`, and `packages/desktop` boundaries.
6. Identify whether the request targets the Template Project or Generated Project payload before editing root docs, `.specs/template/`, `.specs/generated/`, or specs.
7. Use the project scripts before inventing new commands.

## Workspace Map

| Path | Use |
| ---- | --- |
| `packages/ui/src/client/app.rs` | Shared app shell entry component. |
| `packages/ui/src/client/components` | Shared Dioxus components. |
| `packages/ui/src/client/pages` | Routed template pages. |
| `packages/ui/src/client/services` | Client template data, storage, localization, and database services. |
| `packages/ui/assets` | Shared CSS and localization/flag assets. |
| `packages/web/src/main.rs` | Web entrypoint. |
| `packages/desktop/src/main.rs` | Desktop entrypoint. |
| `README.md` | Root documentation, including the Dioxus Features matrix that should stay current as development continues. |
| `Documentation/Images` | README-visible image assets that must be refreshed after this skill is run. |
| `.specs/template` | Template Project guidance and specs for maintaining this reusable template. |
| `.specs/generated` | Generated Project root replacements and starter specs. |
| `Scripts` | Windows PowerShell setup and run workflows. |

## Dioxus 0.7 Constraints

- Use Dioxus `0.7` patterns from the checked-in workspace dependency.
- Do not use `cx`, `Scope`, or `use_state`.
- Use `#[component] fn Name(...) -> Element`.
- Use `use_signal`, `use_memo`, `use_resource`, and signal `.read()`, `.write()`, `.with_mut()`, or call syntax.
- Use `Router::<Route> {}` and Dioxus router links for routing.
- Use `asset!("/path/from/project/root")` for local assets.
- Keep props owned, `Clone`, and `PartialEq`.

## Cache And Loading Behavior

- Preserve visible loading affordances during cache reads, database creation, and refreshes.
- Browser builds use localStorage snapshots instead of browser SQLite.
- Non-wasm builds use native SQLite under local `data/`.
- Put first-time native database/schema/seed setup in `create_database_if_missing()` and keep normal reads non-destructive.
- Treat stale dev servers as a common source of false browser results.

## Verification

Use the narrowest check that proves the change:

```powershell
cargo check -p ui --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo check -p web --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo check -p desktop
.\Scripts\Common\RunWeb.ps1
.\Scripts\Other\RunDesktop.ps1
.\Scripts\Other\RunTests.ps1
```

For browser UI, routing, asset, or cache changes, serve the web app and inspect the actual page when practical.

## Image Refresh Requirement

After running this skill, update the README image assets in `Documentation/Images`:

- `Documentation/Images/Infographic01.png` must be a new custom ChatGPT Images 2.0 or better infographic covering the current repo.
- `Documentation/Images/Screenshot01.png` must be a screenshot of the actual running web app, not a mockup or generated UI image.

Refresh these files in place so the root README image links remain valid. Serve the real web app before capturing `Screenshot01.png`, and verify both images exist before finishing.
